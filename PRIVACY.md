# Privacy policy

herdr picker (the Chrome extension and its native messaging host) does not collect, store or transmit personal data to the developer or to any third party. There are no analytics, no telemetry, no accounts and no remote code.

## What the extension reads

Nothing is read from any page until you trigger the picker on it (the keyboard shortcut or the toolbar icon). When you pick an element and send it, the extension reads from the current page: the page URL, the element's selector path, its trimmed HTML, computed styles, position and viewport size, the prompt you typed and, only when you switch the option on, a screenshot of the element cropped from the visible tab.

## Where it goes

That data is handed to the native messaging host, a process on your computer that Chrome starts and that only this extension can reach. The host passes it to herdr through herdr's local Unix socket, as a prompt for the agent pane you chose. Screenshots and oversized snippets are written to a temporary directory on your machine (`herdr-picker` under the system temp directory) so the agent can read them; the host deletes files older than 24 hours each time it starts.

No data is sent to the developer, to any server or to any third party. What the agent does with the prompt is governed by that agent and by herdr, both running under your account on your machine.

## What is stored in the browser

Two preferences, in the page's own localStorage, per site: the last agent you targeted and whether the screenshot option is on. Nothing else is stored.
