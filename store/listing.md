### Detailed description

```
herdr picker lets you point at any element on any page and hand it, with a prompt, to a coding agent running in herdr on your own machine.

Press Ctrl+B (Control+B on macOS) or click the toolbar icon. Hover to outline elements, click to pick one, Shift+click to select up to five. Type what you want changed and press Enter: the agent you chose receives the element's selector path, its trimmed HTML, computed styles, viewport and position, a source hint when the page carries one (locator attributes or a Vue dev runtime; React's dev runtime gives the component name only) and, if you switch it on, a real-pixel screenshot of the element.

It works on every page you browse: your own apps under any framework or server, staging, production, third-party sites as a visual reference.

WHAT YOU NEED
• herdr (https://herdr.dev) running with at least one agent pane.
• The native messaging host, installed once: npx herdr-picker install-host (macOS and Linux).

HOW IT REACHES HERDR
Chrome starts a small local process, the native messaging host, that only this extension can talk to. The host relays your prompt to herdr's local socket. No localhost port, no token, no server, no account: nothing leaves your machine.

CHOOSE THE AGENT
The To field lists the agents herdr is running, grouped by workspace, and remembers the last one you used on that site. "+ agent here" opens a new agent split next to herdr's focused pane; "+ agent in worktree" starts one in a fresh git worktree. Blocked agents are listed but cannot be targeted. While the agent works, the picked element keeps its outline until the agent settles.

If the host is not installed or herdr is not running, the prompt is copied to your clipboard instead, with the reason shown in the popup.

For pages you serve with Vite there is vite-plugin-herdr: same picker, no extension needed.

## Privacy practices tab

**Single purpose**

```
Send a DOM element the user picks on the current page, with a prompt, to a coding agent running in herdr on the user's own machine.
```

**Permission justifications**

activeTab:

```
Granted only when the user presses the extension's shortcut or clicks its toolbar icon. It lets the extension inject the picker into that tab and, when the user switches the screenshot option on, capture the tab's visible area to crop the picked element. No host permissions are declared: nothing runs on any page until the user asks.
```

scripting:

```
Injects the picker script (content.js, bundled in the package) into the active tab on the user's gesture. No content_scripts are registered in the manifest, so no page is touched automatically.
```

nativeMessaging:

```
Connects to the local native messaging host the user installs with "npx herdr-picker install-host". The host relays the picked element and the prompt to herdr's Unix socket on the user's machine. It is the extension's only channel out; there is no server.
```

Host permissions: none declared, the field stays empty.

**Remote code**: "No, I am not using remote code" (every script is bundled in the package; no eval, no remote scripts).

**Data usage**, "What user data do you plan to collect?": check only **Website content**; everything else unchecked.

Certify all three:

- I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases
- I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose
- I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
